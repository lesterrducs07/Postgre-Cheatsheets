#ANALYTICAL FUNCTION
`RANK()` assigns a rank to each row within a result set, with ties receiving the same rank and leaving gaps. 

`DENSE_RANK()` is similar to `RANK()`, but does not leave gaps between rank values, and so may have ties with the same value. 

`ROW_NUMBER()` assigns a unique number to each row within a result set. 

`LAG()` provides access to a row at a given physical offset prior to the current row within a result set.
